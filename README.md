# Go Learning

This repository contains samples of apps written in Golang.

## How to use
Each directory corresponds to a sample application. Ensure you have Go installed, `cd` into a directory and run:

```
go run main.go
```

Depending on the directory, you need to add the other files to run the application. For instance, in the `cards` directory, do:

```
go run main.go deck.go
```

Run tests with:

```
go test
```

## Notes
- If you have Visual Studio installed, add the Go extension to facilitate coding.
