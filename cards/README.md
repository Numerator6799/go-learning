## How to use
Each folder corresponds to a sample application. Ensure you have Go installed, cd into a folder and run:

```
go run main.go
```

Depending on the folder, you need to add the other files to run the application. For instance, in the cards folder, do:

```
go run main.go deck.go
```

Run tests with:

```
go test
```

## Notes
If you have Visual Studio installed, add the Go extension to facilitate coding.s
